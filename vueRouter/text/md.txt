<div><h2 id="a1">Installation</h2> <h3 id="a2">Compatibility Note</h3> <p>Vue does not support IE8 and below, because it uses ECMAScript 5 features that are un-shimmable in IE8. However it supports all ECMAScript 5 compliant browsers.</p> <h3 id="a3">Release Notes</h3> <p>Latest stable version: 2.5.13</p> <p>Detailed release notes for each version are available on GitHub.</p> </div> <div> <h2 id="a4">Vue Devtools</h2> <p>When using Vue, we recommend also installing the Vue Devtools in your browser, allowing you to inspect and debug your Vue applications in a more user-friendly interface.</p> <h3  id="a5">CDN</h3> <p>Recommended: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue, which will reflect the latest version as soon as it is published to npm. You can also browse the source of the npm package at https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/.</p> <p>Also available on unpkg and cdnjs (cdnjs takes some time to sync so the latest release may not be available yet).</p> </div> <div> <h2 id="a6">NPM</h2> <p>NPM is the recommended installation method when building large scale applications with Vue. It pairs nicely with module bundlers such as Webpack or Browserify. Vue also provides accompanying tools for authoring Single File Components.</p> <pre><code id="lang-"># latest stable $ npm install vue </code></pre> </div> <div> <h2  id="a7">CLI</h2> <p>Vue.js provides an official CLI for quickly scaffolding ambitious Single Page Applications. It provides batteries-included build setups for a modern frontend workflow. It takes only a few minutes to get up and running with hot-reload, lint-on-save, and production-ready builds:</p> <pre><code id="lang-"># install vue-cli $ npm install --global vue-cli # create a new project using the &quot;webpack&quot; template $ vue init webpack my-project # install dependencies and go! $ cd my-project $ npm install $ npm run dev </code></pre> </div>
